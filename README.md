# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It's a sample react app with some goodies inside.

* React context established
* Resize observer updates window dimensions in the react context and sets the app's min-height to window.innerHeight
* react-router-dom
* sass
* TypeScript (with very strict settings)


## Running the project

```
$ docker-compose up
```

## Building the project

```
$ docker-compose run app npm run build
```

You can find the artefacts in the `build` folder.
